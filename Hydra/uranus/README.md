## Sweeper
The default sweeping logic is built into Hydra

## Launcher
By default, Hydra runs your *multi-run* jobs **locally and serially**. 
Other launchers are available as plugins for launching in parallel and on different clusters. 
For example, 
	the *JobLib Launcher* can execute the different parameter combinations in parallel on your local machine using multi-processing.
