# [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/)
- lightweight wrapper around pytorch
- simplifies complex trainig loops
- logging, checkpoint, early-stopping, lr-finder, bach-size, mixed-precision
- seperates engineering, model-design
- easy customizable

# [Hugging face](https://hf.co/)
- focuses more on NLP, now images 
- more abstract in nature



Issues:

- [Docker.raw reserving too much size](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2297) but, all the existing Images, Containers and build cache were gone.
